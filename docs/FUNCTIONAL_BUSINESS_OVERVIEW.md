# Functional and Business Overview

## Functional Capabilities
- **Graph-Oriented Formulation Management**: Centralizes recipes, ingredients, bills of material, processes, and compliance metadata within a Neo4j graph to maintain accurate, connected records.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration Persistence**: Captures agent invocations, task outputs, and generated entities so each automated formulation run is traceable and auditable.
- **GraphRAG-Powered Discovery**: Blends graph queries with retrieval-augmented generation to answer complex questions about formulations, compliance, and supply context.
- **Interactive Graph Explorer**: Offers filtering, searching, schema reset, and export tools that help teams visualize dependencies and impact paths in real time.
- **Formulations Workbench**: Provides tabular search, editing, analytics summaries, and save flows to manage new or existing SKUs collaboratively.
- **Integration Hooks**: API endpoints and ingestion scripts enable synchronization with ERP, MES, and regulatory data sources for end-to-end data continuity.

## Business Needs Addressed
- **Unified Digital Thread**: Links R&D, quality, regulatory, sourcing, and manufacturing data into a single view that reduces silos and accelerates decision making.
- **Regulatory & Compliance Visibility**: Maintains claims, nutrition profiles, risk assessments, and validation reports to support audits and product readiness checks.
- **Operational Agility**: Equips teams to iterate formulations faster while preserving context, ensuring that knowledge from previous runs is reusable.
- **Data-Driven Collaboration**: Provides shared tooling for cross-functional stakeholders to investigate, adjust, and validate formulations without spreadsheet sprawl.

## Problems Solved
- **Fragmented Formulation Data**: Eliminates disconnected spreadsheets and ad hoc documents by consolidating critical formulation information in a graph store.
- **Opaque Automation Runs**: Stores every agent action, input, and output, making AI-driven optimization transparent and defensible.
- **Slow Insight Retrieval**: Uses GraphRAG search to surface relevant knowledge chunks and graph relationships quickly, cutting analysis time.
- **Compliance Uncertainty**: Tracks regulatory mappings and risk factors to highlight gaps before products reach the market.

## Benefits to the F&B Industry
- **Accelerated Innovation Cycles**: Shortens time from ideation to commercialization through reusable orchestration histories and rapid graph queries.
- **Improved Product Quality**: Correlates formulation choices with nutritional, cost, and manufacturing data, enabling better trade-off decisions.
- **Stronger Supply Chain Resilience**: Links suppliers, plants, and risk models to expose single points of failure and support contingency planning.
- **Enhanced Audit Readiness**: Keeps a living record of compliance artifacts, making regulatory submissions and internal reviews smoother.
- **Scalable Knowledge Management**: Converts tacit expertise into structured graph knowledge, supporting onboarding, training, and continual improvement.
